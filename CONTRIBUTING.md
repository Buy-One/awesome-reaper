# Contribution

Thank you for contributing to **Awesome Reaper**!

Please, read the following guidelines and try to follow them to the fullest extent possible.

## Quality standards

The additions to the list should meet the following criteria for inclusion:

* Reaper-centric: Just "created in Reaper" is not enough of a reason.
* Generally useful to the community.
* The resource should be freely-available. Paywalled media, courses, articles or strictly commercial products are not allowed.
* For software, scripts, effects or extensions, Free Software or Open Source are prioritized over freeware or source-available.
* For books, articles and resources, Copyleft and Creative Commons licensed or Public Domain materials are prioritized over copyrighted ones.
* When applicable, a project should be actively maintained and documented.
* Didn't ask [to be excluded from the list](https://github.com/indiscipline/awesome-reaper/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aexclusion+) (details: [Voluntary exclusion](#voluntary-exclusion)).

## Contribution guidelines

Please ensure your contribution adheres to the following guidelines:

* Please, search issues and pull requests before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate or an [exlusion](https://github.com/indiscipline/awesome-reaper/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aexclusion+).
* Follow the established structure of the list or suggest a change in an issue. New categories or categorisation improvements are welcome.
* Points should follow the format: \[NAME\]\(LINK\) - DESCRIPTION. You can add complimentary link to the description.
* Follow alphabetical order within each category.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
* End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Please, restrain from using qualitative descriptions such as: "best", "nice", "greatest", etc.

## Commit and Pull Request guidelines:

* Individual pull request for each change. Multiple changes within a single subcategory is OK.
* Please, squash your commits prior to opening the pull request.
* Keep descriptions short and simple.
* Include motivation for your additions in the pull request description.

## Voluntary exclusion

Some resources wish to not be linked anywhere or, occasionally, here specifically.

If you wish to be excluded from this list, we ask the responsible party to file an issue titled `Exclusion request: Name of the Resource` and the `exlcusion` label, to log the request and prevent future readditions.

## Git basics

If you're new to Git-based collaboration, GitHub features a comprehensive documentation section.

For your pull-requests, follow the [quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).

### TLDR:

- Fork the repository.
- Create a new branch.
- Add a single meaningful change.
- Commit with a short descriptive title and description explaining the motivation for the change.
- Create a pull request from your fork to the original repository.
